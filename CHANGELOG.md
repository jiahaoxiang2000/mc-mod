## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added

- **Runtime Configuration System** - Change wireframe colors and settings without restarting!
  - `/buildmode color [preset]` command to change to predefined colors (blue, green, yellow, purple, cyan, white)
  - `/buildmode color [r] [g] [b] [a]` command to set custom RGBA wireframe colors
  - `/buildmode reach [distance]` command to adjust preview reach distance (1-10 blocks)
  - `/buildmode info` command to display current configuration settings
  - All changes take effect immediately without client restart
- **Extended Block Placement** - Place blocks at the same distance as wireframe previews!
  - **BlockPlacementHandler** enables placing blocks beyond vanilla reach distance
  - Automatic pattern-based placement - place entire patterns with one click
  - Matches configurable reach distance from BuildModeConfig
- **Mouse Wheel Pattern Switching** - Scroll to cycle through build patterns when build mode is active
  - Scroll up for next pattern, scroll down for previous pattern
  - Prevents normal hotbar scrolling when build mode is active
  - Optional pattern name display in action bar
- **BuildModeConfig** singleton class for managing runtime settings
- **BuildModeCommand** class providing comprehensive command system
- Auto-completion support for color preset commands
- **Build Mode System** - Press 'B' to toggle wireframe preview mode for faster, more accurate building

  - Real-time wireframe previews follow cursor position (default: blue wireframes)
  - Multiple build patterns: Single Block, 3x3 Wall, 5x5 Floor, 5-block Pillar, 5-block Line
  - Client-side only rendering with minimal performance impact
  - 5-block reach distance for preview placement
  - No confirmation dialogs - instant visual feedback for building assistance
